# DisjointSet

## 0 --> in naive.py implemeted the naive approach to make the disjoint set where time compleity to find is O(1) and for union is O(n)
## 1 --> in rank_heuristics  time complexity to find and union is the O(logn) as in the forest height of any tree is at most logn
## 2 --> in path_compression find and union will have the amortized time  of O(log*n)
